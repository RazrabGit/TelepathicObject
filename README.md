(See more information in the game bestiary...)
# Description
This mod adds a new dangerous telepathic mob: Burer, from the game "S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat". Unfortunately, for the sake of game balance and the complexity of writing code, not all mutant abilities were ready, for example, throwing objects at the player. Perhaps in the future this will be implemented. Now the burer has two abilities: to push the player away with a small wave and to exhaust him, knocking out items from his inventory. You can configure some of the values ​​responsible for the enemy's behavior in the mod config.

# Known issues
- A rare bug where the player will lose the ability to interact with anything if they will pick up an item at the exact moment the burer will try to knock items out of the player's inventory. At the moment I don't know how to fix it, because the function of dropping objects is taken from the game itself, I didn't write it myself. If someone knows how to fix it, you can write it in the Discord thread, the source code of the mod is open. For now, you can disable this ability for the enemy in mod config.
